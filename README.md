## Welcome to the CSS-selectors Trainer project!

This trainer is designed to help users practice and improve their skills in writing CSS selectors. The trainer consists of multiple levels, each featuring a sample layout and HTML code corresponding to the current level. Some elements in the layout are highlighted using animation, and the user's task is to write a CSS selector that targets all the highlighted elements.

Happy training! ðŸš€
